# Temperature & Mood Correlation Study  

## Overview  
This project examines the relationship between **temperature** and **public mood**.  
We combine **OpenWeather API** (for temperature data) and **Twitter sentiment analysis** (for mood data) to test whether hotter or colder days influence how people express themselves online.  

---

## Objectives  
- Collect daily **temperature data** from the OpenWeather API.  
- Collect tweets (via Twitter API or use a public dataset).  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** using TextBlob or VADER.  
- Compute a **daily mood score** and compare it with temperature.  
- Visualise results with line and scatter plots.
